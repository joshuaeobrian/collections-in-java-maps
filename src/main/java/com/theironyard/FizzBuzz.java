public class FizzBuzz {

    /**
     * Create a static method named asMap(). This method implements a variation
     * on the classic FizzBuzz exercise. The method should accept an int
     * argument named `max`. The method will iterate from 1 to max (inclusive)
     * and create a HashMap that is keyed by Strings and contains values that
     * are Arrays of Integers.
     *
     * The HashMap returned will have three keys:
     *
     * fizz - This is an Array of integers in the range 1 to `max` inclusive
     *      that are divisible by 3 (but not 5). EG: 3, 6, 9, etc.
     *
     * buzz - This is an Array of integers in the range 1 to `max` inclusive
     *      that are divisible by 5 (but not 3). EG: 5, 10, 20, etc.
     *
     * fizzbuzz - This is an Array of integers in the range 1 to `max` inclusive
     *      that are divisible by both 3 and 5. EG: 15, 30, 45, etc.
     *
     * All other numbers are disregarded.
     *
     * So, if the `max` argument provided is 45, this method will return a
     * HashMap that looks like this:
     *
     * {
     *  fizz -> [3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 21, 24, 27, 33, 36, 39, 42],
     *  buzz -> [5, 10, 20, 25, 35, 40],
     *  fizzbuzz -> [15, 30, 45]
     * }
     *
     * @param max The maximum number to iterate to when generating the HashMap
     * @return A HashMap of Strings mapped to an Array of Integers containing keys and values for fizz, buzz, and fizzbuzz
